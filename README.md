# Cyclistic-Case-Study
This repo contains a case study of a fictional company, Cyclistic, as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The business task was to discover bike riding habits of the 2 types of customers: Casual Riders and Members.

Some of the insights generated include:

- Casual Riders tend to ride 2.5 times longer than Members.
- Use of the bike sharing program is seasonal eg riders generally decrease in the winter months and begin increasing thereafter.
- Average bike time peaked over the weekend.

Some of the recommendations include:

- Implement different rider rates depending on the season.
- Implement a higher cost per minute at a lower time allotment to incentivize casual riders to purchase annual memberships.
- Reduce the time allotment that casual riders can use the bikes to incentivize them to purchase annual memberships.

The case study was analyzed in R and implemented using Google Colab.
